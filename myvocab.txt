low quality
8 5
worse than this
say didn't
left
shy
work of art
it's well
film that
struggles
again again
horror flick
only reason to
film highly
intimate
thing about this movie
two men

faithful
with many
for both
just horrible
still one of

substance
that director

better if
hour of

pass
of talent
rather watch
meandering
international film festival
uh
randomly
good too
movies ever seen
very well made
here's
this sequel
recommend to anyone who
own risk
more boring
maybe if
that looks like
unexciting
that so bad
jimmy
that wasted
had misfortune
that this movie
pay
how good
lonely
consequences of

bravo
those of
better script
of all ages
caught
no where
to say about

should stick
bad so
little gem
nothing else to
only assume
redeem
dealing with
attempt to be
it's one of best
subsequent
form
it's one
ripoff
relationship between

blah blah blah
to say about this
slow motion
rubber
ran out of
